      <h2>Meet Athena</h2>
      <p>
        Athena Devika joined our family in 2019, just after my husband and I got married.
        We adopted her as a companion for my husband’s birthday — but she quickly became
        my sidekick and best friend. She’s a loyal, loving, and endlessly energetic
        German Shepherd and Rottweiler mix with a heart as big as her bark.

      <h3>Travel Buddy Extraordinaire</h3>
      <p>
        Athena has been all over Seattle, Oregon, and Idaho — she even braved a terrible
        storm through Grants Pass, Oregon, standing strong beside me like the rock she is.

      <h3>My Training Partner</h3>
      <p>
        She’s run and walked miles with me while I trained for Army endurance tests.
        She never quits, never complains — just that tail wag and tongue out grin.

      <h3>The Cuddle Queen</h3>
      <p>
        Despite her strong stance, Athena is a total cuddle bug. She sleeps in the most
        hilarious positions — often legs-up, curled into a “C,” and sometimes halfway under
        the bed. We once thought we lost her during a nap because she was hidden so well!

    <h2>Today 💫</h2>
    <p>
      Athena’s getting older now, with a bit of gray around her snout and a few extra pounds,
      but she still has the same spark in her eyes and energy in her paws. She’s our family’s
      favorite girl and my forever sidekick.
